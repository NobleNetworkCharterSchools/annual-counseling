## Process and Notebook for annual college counseling tool refresh
The code here is used for creating an updated college directory and
all other source tables for Noble college counseling tools

Development has been conducted in a private repo, but most of this process
should eventually be made public (private data marked in the list below as
such)

### This repo is divided into three main sections:

# Markdown Workbooks (interactive, commented description of the work):
